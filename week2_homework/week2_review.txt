AWS
Cloud / AWS Overview
How would you describe AWS? What is "the cloud" or "cloud computing" and why is it so popular now?
- Amazon Web Services is a cloud platform with tools for enterprise companies and developers.
- The cloud is what lets users access a shared file or app from any device.
- Cloud computing is the resources that is delievered on demand with pay-as-you-go payments.
- The reason cloud computing is so popular and businesses usually switch to is because: 
	- reliable
	- it saves money (not having to manage your own servers) and you only pay for what you use
	- no more guessing about how much capacity you will need (buying too much or too little) 
	- an increase of speed and agility 

Define Infrastructure, Platform, and Software as a Service
- Iaas: servers, storage and resources managed from a remote data center that customers can use and innovate via an internet connection
- Paas: cloud-based platform that provides everything needed for building a specific application 
- Saas: software/application that users will pay a monthly fee to use, hosted in the cloud. 

What's the difference between a Region and an Availability Zone (AZ)?
- Region: geographical location with collection of availability zones with physical data centers in the region
	- inside regions are 2 or more availability zones, hosted in seperate data centers
- AZ: logical data center inside a region, available for any AWS customer
	- each zone has seperate power, networking and connectivity to reduce multiple zone failure

How are you charged for using AWS services? Does it vary by service?
- Autoscalability: You ONLY pay for the services you use. 
	- Your combined usage of services will create a monthly bill. 

Different ways to interact with AWS services?
- RDS: hosting a database, configures and maintains your database
- EC2: elastic cloud compute, virtual machine on the cloud
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI): template that contains software configuration
- Elastic block storage (EBS): block storage associated with an ec2
- Security groups: details what traffic is allowed in & out

EC2
What are the configuration options for EC2?
- AWS Management Console: simple web based user interface
- Command line interface
- Programming with Amazon RDS: developers can access programmatically use SDKs

What are the different EC2 instance sizes/types?
- EC2 has a wide selection of instance types that are used to optimized to fit varying applications. 
	- give you the option to choose what resources you need for your app
- Ie: T4g, T2, M6g, M5, A1, C4: c4.large

Once you create an EC2, how to connect to it?
- ssh into the ec2 using 'ssh -i [file.pem] ec2-user@[address]'

What are Security Groups? When defining a rule for a security group, what 3 things do you need to specify?
- Security groups act like a virtual firewall for EC2 instances that control traffic going in/out.
- things to specify when defining a security group: 
	- port range
	- icmp type and code
	- source or destination: IPv4 address

What's the difference between scalability, elasticity, and resiliency?
- Scalability: increase the workload size inside exisiting infrastructure without impacting performance
- Elasticity: ability adding or removing infrastructure resources depending on workload changes
- Resiliency: ability for a server to recover and continue operations without systems connected to the network going down

Ways of paying for EC2?
- On-demand
- Savings plans
- Reserved instances
- Spot instances

RDS
What's an RDS?
- A Relational Database Service provides a selection of databases built to save, grow and innovate faster. 

Which vendors are supported?
- Amazon Aurora MySQL
- Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- SQL Server
